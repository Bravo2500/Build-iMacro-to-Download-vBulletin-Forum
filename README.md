# Build iMacro to Download vBulletin Forum
I wanted to download specific information from a vBulletin forum. I found Scrapy more work than I cared for and I couldn't go back and target specific pages without more trouble. I found that the typical web site mirror/scraping program chokes on the number of unnecessary links that vBulletin can generate.

This program targets the two things I cared about downloading: threads and member info pages. You can also go back and easily target specific threads and new members.

Note: While I avoid Internet Explorer sort of like the plague, I found that it was the only browser that would give me a good MHT file.

Use:

- Generate the iMacro file
- Login to the vBulletin forum using IE, preferably in a VM you can do a rollback on after you are done downloading and moving the data out of the VM
- Load iMacro by clicking on the icon in IE
- Click Record on iMacro
- Click Stop Recording
- Click Edit Macro
- Paste in the generated iMacro file
- Click Play
- Wait for the process to complete
- Save the MHT files off to storage

----------
- Written using Python 2.7
- The regex's may have to be tweaked for different forum versions or configurations
